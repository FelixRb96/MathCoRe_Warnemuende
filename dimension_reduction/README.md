# Dimension reduction and clustering 

Topics covered are: 

* Dimension reduction with principal component analysis (PCA) to find linear combinations that preserve as much variance of the data as possible and are uncorrelated. 
* Dimension reduction with factor analysis (FA) to fit a latent model to the data to determine possible hidden factors. 
* Clustering with hierarchical clustering, a simple easy to apply algorithm that merges clusters that are close together in some sense. 
* Clustering with $k$-means clustering to segment the data into $k$ regions such that the data minimizes the distance to some middle points. 
* Mixture modelling with gaussian mixture models (GMM) to assign group probabilities to data.
